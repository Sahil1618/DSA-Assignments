int main() { 
int a = 500, b, c ; 
if ( a >= 400 ) 
b = 300 ; 
c = 200 ; 
cout << "value of b and c are respectively “ <<b<<” and ” << c  ; 
	return 0;
}


Ans : 
According to the question the value of a is 500 which satisfies the condition given in if block and the if 
block will be executed and value of b and c will become 300 and 200 respectively.
a = 500
b = 300
c = 200
